There are essentially two possible actions per turn: spawn or move. You can choose exactly one of them for each turn.

1. Spawn: Several grids on the board have a red background. A connected component of red- background grids is called a **city**. For example, there're 9 cities in the example map, outlined by the following image. 

A player **controls** a city if: first, at least one grid of the city contains his army; second, no grid in the city contains army of others. 

In a spawn action, for **each city** you control, you can spawn a PAWN in an empty grid of the city. 

2. Move: In a move action, you can move any number of your armies. However, one army is only allowed to move once each turn. 

   If you move to a grid containing another army (even if its yours), that army will be eliminated and you will get the corresponding exp. 

3. After the action, there is the upgrade phase. Exp is useful for upgrade. There are 4 levels of army: 1. PAWN; 2. Archer; 3. Knight; 4. Tank. To increase the level of an army by 1, you need to spend one exp. 

   Pawn moves wasd. Archer moves wasd but diagonally. Knight moves like a knight. 

   Tank is a special level. It moves by wasd, but is more costy: you need to spend an exp each time moving it around. But it's empowered with an extra power: you can make a tank stay on its grid, while eliminating any of nonyours armies in the 8 grids as illustrated below. 

   Tank can only be obtained from a pawn directly: you need to consequently update three times to get a tank. 

   If you eat pwan/archer, you will get 1 exp. If you eat knight or tank, you will get 2. 

   4. Gaming Goal: If after a player's turn, there's no his army in his capital, he loses the game. You win by eliminating your opponents. 
   4. The green disks are NPC. Some grids are outlined red, meaning they are **tracks** for NPC. NPC will never move outside the tracks. Whenever an NPC is adjacent to an army of players, it will move and eliminate the army immediately. If multiple NPCs are available, they will move in the priority of :going up, down, left, right. All NPCs are pawns.

In this game, there are two options for each turn: spawning new units or moving existing units. 

To spawn new units, a player must control a city, which is a connected group of red-background grids on the board. To control a city, a player's army must occupy at least one grid in the city and no other player's army must occupy any grids in the city. For each city a player controls, they can spawn a new pawn on an empty grid within that city. 

In a move action, a player can move any number of their armies, but each army can only move once per turn. If an army moves to a grid occupied by another army, that army is eliminated and the player earns experience points. Players earn experience points by eliminating enemy units: 1 point for pawns or archers, and 2 points for knights or tanks.

After taking an action, there is an upgrade phase where players can use their experience points to increase the level of their armies from pawn to archer, knight, and finally tank. 

Pawns move in the cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), while archers can only move diagonally. Knights move in the pattern of a chess knight.

Tanks can move in the cardinal directions but require an experience point to be spent each time they move. Tanks also have the special ability to eliminate any non-ally armies on the 8 surrounding grids while remaining stationary. Tanks can only be obtained by upgrading a pawn three times in a row. 

The goal of the game is to eliminate all enemy armies and capture their capital city.
